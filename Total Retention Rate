### Retention Rate 
### Create tables

SELECT
    o.Customer_ID,
    o.Order_Time,
    p.Product_Name
  FROM
    `keepcalmqueryon.mina.order_detail` as o
  LEFT JOIN `mina.products` as p 
  ON o.SKU = p.SKU;
  
  
  ### Join tables 
  
  SELECT
    r1.Customer_ID,
    r1.Order_Time AS date1,
    r2.Order_Time AS date2,
    r1.Product_Name
  FROM
    `keepcalmqueryon.mina.retention1_1` AS r1
  LEFT JOIN
    `keepcalmqueryon.mina.Retention1_2` AS r2
  ON
    r1.Customer_ID = r2.Customer_ID
    AND r1.Order_Time < r2.Order_Time;

### Create rolling based retention rate
